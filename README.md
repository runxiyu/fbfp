# Feedback {from,for} peers, a peer marking/commentary system

The status of this project is that it's currently just an *idea*.  At
the end of the day it probably just targets the audience at YK Pao
School because I don't have time to maintain a project that could be
used by others.

Unsolved questions:
* What do we even want?
* How should the "commentary" page even work?  JavaScript is *probably*
  required here, but I know absolutely no JavaScript and I do *not* want
  to use a bloated "framework".
* Should I write it in Go or Python?
  If it's Python, how should I deploy it?  (As a Flask blueprint into
  `ykps-wsgi` or at its independent subdomain?)

	Please note that work or comments marked "anonymous" are only anonymous to normal end-users.  People with direct access to the database, and other people with administrative privileges on the server or in the service, are able to see names that are supposed to be anonymous. This is necessary because we need some way to identify owners, so that owners could update or delete their own work.

	We use cookies to store session data e.g. to save callback messages and to allow users to log in.
	</p>
	<p>
	We occasionally use JavaScript for things that are useful to be done client-side (e.g. checking the size of a file upload before form submission), and in cases where it is the "obvious" way to implement something (e.g. using JavaScript to implement an annotation system instead of using a CSS state machine). We do not abuse JavaScript.
